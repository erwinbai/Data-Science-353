1. The definition of hacking p-values is not lieing to ourself which means we should not "design a experiment to get the conclusion we want"(Lecture notes Hacking p-values). Since our data is randomly generated and tested with 7 different sorting algorithm, we never manipulate the data. Therefore, I do not believe we are p-hacking.

2. By counting the groups1/2 in posthoc table, we need to do 21 comparison between all 7 sorting algorithm.
   Since we are measuring with significance level of 0.05, our confidence level is 95%. With 21 comparison, we have 0.95^21 = 0.34056162628 chance to get all conclusions correct

3.From the sorted table:
partition_sort    0.007313
qs1               0.009864
qs5               0.013576
merge1            0.013611
qs4               0.014045
qs2               0.014088
qs3               0.014368


Partition_sort is the fastest

From posthoc table reject column
We can not distinguishe between merge1 and qs5, and qs2 and qs4
