1.Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

	The residual histogram does not look like in bell-shape and our p-value is really small(1.5139606492959894e-106). Meaning I can not conclude that the ratins are increasing 


2.Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

	From the graphs, we can see that we have a clear bell-shaped(normal) histogram and more spikes for our outliers. Meaning its captureing more signal than before. I think the new "better" prediciton is letting the kalman filter doing a better job.
